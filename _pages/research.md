## Online Privacy
 Preserving online privacy ensures that individuals can control the information they share online, protecting them from identity theft, financial fraud, and other cyber threats. My recent research has been focused on the design of a privacy-aware monitoring system in an Industry 4.0 setting that relies on context-based model to detect emergency situations and discosles workers' personal data to operators only when there is an emergency. Another reserach theme I'm currently investigating is related to empirically measure potential violations of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) within web sites and mobile applications and design tools to automatically detect such violations.

## Identity and Access Management
Identity and Access Management is an important part of cybersecurity in that it helps an organization to manage who and what has access to an organization’s systems, important data and resources. Identity Management verifies that entity that’s attempting to access a resource matches their identity, while access management keeps track of which resources the entity has permission to access. My recent research has been focused on empirically investigating security vulnerabilities present in FIDO 2 authentication protocols real-word deployements, and devising approches based on machine learning to refine attribute-based access control policies in order to reduce the risks of users abusing their privileges.

## Cyber Risk Assessment

Cyber risk assessment it’s crucial for all organizations to stay ahead of emerging cybersecurity trends and risks. It allows to identify, assess and mitigate risks posed by cybr attacks to an organization's assets. It is also crucial component of the software develepoment life cycle (SDLC) that allows to design and build software that is secure by design. My recent research is focused on devising you approaches to estimate the security risks associated with the execution of a business process rather than with a single activity like most cyber risk assessment methodologies and 
standardss. I'm working on the design of novel approach based on Large Language Models (LLMs) to detect vulnerabilites in software and automatically fix the code.
