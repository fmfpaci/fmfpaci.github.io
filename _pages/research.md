## Identity and Access Management
Identity and Access Management is an important part of cybersecurity in that it helps an organization to manage who and what has access to an organization’s systems, important data and resources. 
My research has been focused on designing 
access control and identity management systems that not only guarantee access to an organization assets only to the right users but that also preserve the privacy of the personal information that users have provided to verify their identities
and prove they satisfy access control policies. My recent research has been focused on empirically investigating security vulnerabilities present in FIDO 2 authentication protocols real-word deployements, and devising approches based on machine learning to refine attribute-based access control policies in order to reduce the risks of users abusing their privileges.
