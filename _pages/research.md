## Identity and Access Management
Identity and Access Management is an important part of cybersecurity in that it helps an organization to manage who and what has access to an organization’s systems, important data and resources. Identity Management, while Access Control
My research has been focused on designing 
access control and identity management systems that not only guarantee access to an organization assets only to the right users but that also preserve the privacy of the personal information that users have provided to verify their identities
and prove they satisfy access control policies. My recent research has been focused on empirically investigating security vulnerabilities present in FIDO 2 authentication protocols real-word deployements, and devising approches based on machine learning to refine attribute-based access control policies in order to reduce the risks of users abusing their privileges.

## Cyber Risk Assessment

Cyber risk assessment it’s crucial for all organizations to stay ahead of emerging cybersecurity trends and risks. It allows to identify, assess and mitigate risks posed by cybr attacks to an organization's assets. It is also crucial component of the software develepoment life cycle (SDLC) that allows to design and build software that is secure by design. My recent research is focused on devising you approaches to estimate the security risks associated with the execution of a business process activity or trace and on the design of new approach based on Large Language Models (LLMs) to detect vulnerabilites in software and automatically fix the code.
